        <h2>About the Website</h2>
        <p>Clean and green energy represents the future of sustainable development, offering eco-friendly alternatives to fossil fuels that protect our planet and ensure long-term energy security. Technologies such as solar power harness the sun’s abundant rays, while wind energy converts the natural motion of air into electricity without emissions. Tidal and wave energy capture the rhythmic movement of oceans, and Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) utilizes temperature differences between surface and deep seawater to generate power. Meanwhile, biomass energy transforms organic waste into usable fuel, closing the loop on resource cycles. Together, these renewable energy sources reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and pave the way toward a cleaner, greener, and more resilient world.</p>

    <section id="wave" class="hidden">
      <h1>Wave Energy Conversion System</h1>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/wave.png.png">
        <h2>Source of Energy</h2>
        <p>The system utilizes wave energy from ocean waves as its main renewable energy source. The continuous motion of waves provides mechanical energy that can be harnessed without producing greenhouse gases, making it a sustainable power option for coastal regions.</p>
        <h2>Conversion Process</h2>
        <p>A Wave Energy Converter (WEC) array captures the mechanical energy from ocean waves and removes large particles and suspended solids. This motion is then transferred to the Power Take-Off (PTO) system, which converts it into hydraulic or electrical power. The generated raw power is then processed in a Power Conditioning Unit to produce stable electricity suitable for desalination equipment. Some of this power may be stored in energy storage systems for continuous operation.</p>
        <h2>Output / Utilization</h2>
        <p>The electrical power drives the reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant. Seawater is drawn through an intake system, filtered in a pre-treatment unit, and then forced through RO membranes to separate pure water from salts. The energy recovery device reuses energy from brine discharge, improving efficiency.</p>
        <h2>Real-World Application Relevance</h2>
        <p>This technology is ideal for coastal and island regions, providing freshwater and clean energy simultaneously. It supports sustainable development by reducing dependency on fossil fuels and addressing freshwater scarcity in remote coastal communities.</p>

    <section id="biogas" class="hidden">
      <h1>Biomass-Based Biogas Generation System</h1>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/biogas2.png.png">
        <h2>Source of Energy</h2>
        <p>The system uses biomass energy derived from cattle manure as its main source. In a dairy farm with 100 cattle, large quantities of manure are generated daily. This manure is rich in organic compounds such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which serve as fuel for microbial digestion. Instead of being wasted or causing pollution, the manure is converted into biogas, a clean and renewable source of energy.</p>
        <h2>Conversion Process</h2>
        <p>The collected manure is fed into a sealed biogas digester, where it undergoes anaerobic digestion—a biological process in which bacteria break down organic material in the absence of oxygen. During this process, biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) is released and directed into a gas holder for storage. The remaining digestate (slurry) coming out of the digester contains both liquid and solid fractions. These are sent to a separator, where liquids and solids are divided. The liquid fraction can be used as a bio-liquid fertilizer, while the solid fraction is converted into organic compost suitable for improving soil fertility.</p>
        <img src="C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/biogas1.png.png">
        <h2>Output / Utilization</h2>
        <p>The biogas collected can be used as a substitute for LPG in cooking, heating, or power generation. The compost and bio-slurry enhance crop yield naturally without chemical fertilizers.</p>
        <h2>Real-World Application Relevance</h2>
        <p>This biogas system ensures waste management, renewable energy generation, and nutrient recycling. It supports sustainable dairy farm operations, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and provides farmers with both clean energy and valuable organic manure, promoting a circular rural economy.</p>

    <section id="otec" class="hidden">
      <h1>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) System</h1>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/otec.png.png"> 
        <h2>Source of Energy</h2>
        <p>The OTEC system derives its energy from the temperature difference between warm surface seawater (25–28°C) and cold deep seawater (around 5°C). This thermal gradient provides a steady and renewable source of heat energy available in tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the year.</p>
        <h2>Conversion Process</h2>
        <p>The warm seawater acts as the heat source and passes through an evaporator, where it heats a low-boiling-point working fluid, converting it from liquid to vapor. The high-pressure vapor then drives a turbine, which is connected to an electrical generator, producing electricity. The vapor exiting the turbine is cooled using cold seawater in the condenser, where it condenses back into liquid form. A working fluid pump recirculates the fluid to maintain the closed-loop power cycle.</p>
        <h2>Output / Utilization</h2>
        <p>The system generates electricity that can be supplied to the shore. Additionally, a flash evaporator or warm seawater desalination unit uses the remaining heat energy to produce pure desalinated freshwater, supporting local water needs.</p>
        <h2>Real-World Application Relevance</h2>
        <p>OTEC is highly suitable for island nations and coastal regions, offering sustainable electricity and freshwater production with minimal environmental impact. It ensures continuous power supply, making it ideal for remote and developing coastal areas.</p>
